* New install instructions

### Features: ###
* Incredible features and fast workflow

### New Features for Rope - Crystal: ###
* New, slightly improved GUI
* Merged Source Faces. Select multiple Source Faces to create an average Source Face result. Combine different people to create a blend, or select the same person from different Source Faces to improve the likeness of the person
* Source Faces Shortcuts to always have access to your favorite faces. Works with Merged Source Faces too!
* Improvements to layout for workflow efficiency
* Improvements to Target/Source Face selection for workflow efficiency
* Mousescroll on Target/Source Faces and Target Videos
* Much lower memory requirements (only 2.7GB if you don't enable GFPGAN, CLIP, etc.)
* Mouse scrolling in the video player cycles through the Source Faces for the selected Target Face. Quickly view your Source Faces against the Target Face!
* More speed improvements. Results below. I'll start tracking benchmarks for each release
* (experimental) Mouth parser. Another occlusion tool just for the mouth area. Improves dialogue and lip sync, but will replace the Source Face mouth.
